        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 testimonial_QA">
          <h4 class="question">Can you tell us a little about yourself and your firm?</h4>

          <h5>We are a firm of Chartered Accountants acting for owner managed businesses across London. 
            Our team is currently 9 people and due to Covid-19 we are operating remotely.</h5>
          <br>
          <h4 class="question">Can you tell us why you moved to Senta?</h4>

          <p><h5>As a firm we use a multitude of software companies, all of which were not joined together. 
            We needed a single voice of reason for workflow and managing our client engagement.</h5></p>

          <p><h5>We previously used Iris PM for workflow management along with our CRM solution, 
          this had offered no improvement over the 10 years I have used it.</h5></p>

          <p><h5>Moving to Senta was an in depth procurement process, however, we finally settled due to its overall malleability, meaning we can customise every area.</h5></p>
          <br>
          <h4 class="question">How did your migration to Senta go?</h4>
          <p><h5>We tried to install it ourselves, this simply did not go well.</h5></p>

          <p><h5>Around managing our existing workflow, it did not get the attention it required to gain the benefits of what Senta has to offer.</h5></p>

          <p><h5>We then decided to use Spindrift to install our Senta from scratch, ditching our previous effort. 
            So our existing data import could go through a client data audit.</h5></p>

          <p><h5>Spindrift then reviewed our current workflows with our team to review what could be automated and where time savings could be optimised.</h5></p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 testimonial_QA">
          <h4 class="question">What are the top 3 outcomes from the implementation of Senta?</h4>
            <h5>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Time Saving</strong> - using the automation available to engage with our clients and save time e.g our revised tax return process with 
                  automatic reminders and confirmation emails, has saved the team around 45 minutes per return.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Visibility</strong> - For both senior management & the operational team, having overall visibility on all workflow means we can pin point workflow 
                  issues in advance and reallocate across the team. All in the cloud to view from anywhere, as opposed to on a server in my office.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong> - redesigning our job workflows has ensured that all key planning and compliance tasks are tracked and accountable, 
                meaning the service we offer our clients can be consistently monitored.</li>
              </ol>
            </h5>
          <br>
          <h4 class="question">How did you find working with Spindrift on this assignment?</h4>
          <p><h5>Our whole team worked with Adam on the project, with all team members saying how professional and understanding he was.</h5></p>

          <p><h5>With some team members unsure of change, Adam was able to objectively show the benefits of installing the system and ultimately saving them time to work on more 
            interesting client work than administrative low value tasks.</h5></p>
